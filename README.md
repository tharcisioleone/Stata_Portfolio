# Welcome to my Stata Portfolio !
You will find here some examples of my empirical work using Stata. The files refer to the studies "Does a productivity bonus pay off?" and "Remote learning under stress". To see the final version of the files in PDF, please visit my private homepage: [Tharcisio Leone](https://tharcisio-leone.com/publication/).

If you're using my code, you are welcome to connect with me on LinkedIn and optionally send me feedback to help steer this or other code I have already published: [Tharcisio Leone](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tharcisio-leone/).
